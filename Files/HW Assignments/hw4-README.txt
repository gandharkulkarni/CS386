HW4 aims to create an HTML form with JavaScript field validation. It consists of three parts: creating the HTML form, styling it using CSS, and implementing the necessary JavaScript functions.

Part 1 involves creating the HTML form (hw4.html) with essential elements such as a header, fieldset, form, labels linked to text inputs, and two regular buttons.

Part 2 requires creating a CSS file (hw4.css) and linking it to the HTML page. It provides styling for the fieldset element, label elements, and a class attribute named "asterisk" for styling asterisks with the color red.

Part 3 involves creating a JavaScript file (hw4.js) and linking it to the HTML page. It sets up a load or DOMContentLoaded event with an event handler named "fLoad." This function also establishes click event handlers for both buttons: "login" and "reset."

For the login button, the event handler is "fValidation," which performs field validation by checking the length of the input values. It sets the background color to red if the length is zero and green if it is greater than zero.

For the reset button, the event handler is "fReset," which clears any previous entries and removes the red background color from the input fields.

Please refer to the individual files (hw4.html, hw4.css, hw4.js) for the complete implementation of the HTML form with JavaScript field validation.
