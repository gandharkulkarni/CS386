        <h2>Selecting <abbr title="Hyper text markup language">HTML</abbr> To Style</h2>
        <p id="main">Selecting the right element and providing the right visual styles is the basis of 
		<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">writing CSS</a> code. 
		Whenever you need to adjust how an element on a webpage looks, using selectors is key.</p>
        <p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">Read 
		this to learn more about selectors</a></p>

        <h2 class="content-width">The Type Selector</h2>
        <p class="content-width">The type selector finds elements on the page by tag name. This is a common way to 
		style elements on the page. Type selectors are often referred to as element selectors.</p>

        <h2>Combining Selectors</h2>
        <p>A combinator selector is defined by a space character between selectors, with the 
		HTML ancestry reading left to right. The right-most selector is the intended target. 
		This can be as complex or as simple as necessary to <em>scope</em>, or provide 
		sufficient specificity, to the intended element.</p>
